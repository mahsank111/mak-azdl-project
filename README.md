# 🧩 Azure Data Engineering Project: End-to-End ETL Pipeline

This project showcases a complete **ETL pipeline** using **Microsoft Azure**, modeled on the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**. It demonstrates real-world **data engineering practices**, leveraging the Azure ecosystem to ingest, transform, and serve data for analytical and business insights.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Build a scalable Azure-based pipeline that:

- Ingests structured data from GitHub
- Cleans & transforms it using Azure Databricks (PySpark)
- Stores data across **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers** in ADLS Gen2
- Enables querying via Synapse Serverless SQL
- Visualizes insights with Power BI

## 🗃️ Project Breakdown

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)

- Used **Azure Data Factory** to copy CSV files from GitHub into the **Bronze** container in ADLS.
- Stored files in original structure, untouched and unprocessed.

### 2️⃣ Data Transformation (Silver Layer)

- Set up **secure access** between **Databricks and ADLS** using Managed Identity.
- Loaded raw data files (e.g., Product, Customer, Sales, Returns) into Databricks.
- Cleaned, filtered, and performed joins using **PySpark**.
- Saved transformed outputs into the **Silver** container.

### 3️⃣ Data Serving (Gold Layer)

- Created **external tables** in **Azure Synapse Analytics (Serverless SQL)** using `OPENROWSET`.
- Tables serve as the Gold layer for query and reporting.

### 4️⃣ Reporting (Power BI)

- Connected **Power BI** directly to **Synapse SQL** using **DirectQuery**.
- Built a dashboard that displays:
  - **Total Customers** (Card)
  - **Order Quantity Trends** (Line Chart)
  - **Revenue by Product Category** (Bar/Pie Chart)
  - **Top Performing Products** (Horizontal Bar)
